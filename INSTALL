Prerequisites #
###############

DFS is a collection of Python 2.7 and Cython libraries and scripts and is 
supported on Linux and OS X/macOS. Installing the dfs package and running the
scripts has the following
requirements:

* Python 2.x (>= 2.7)
* Cython >= 0.18
* Python 2 packages: setuptools, numpy, h5py, prody
* Python and numpy headers
* a C compiler (as GNU gcc)

The installation instructions that follow also cover the installation  of 
prerequisites for the most common cases; please refer to your system 
administrator or specific OS documentation in case these are not approriate
for your system.

Installation #
##############

Linux - Debian-based (Debian, Ubuntu and others)
-------------------------------------------------

On Ubuntu, the prerequisites can be installed using the package manager apt:

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cython python-dev \
    python-numpy python-setuptools python-pip python-h5py build-essential

Please note that all the commands that start with "sudo" need to be run as a 
super-user in some Debian-based distributions.

Once the installation of these packages is complete, you need to install the 
prody package separately through pip, either system-wide:

    sudo pip install prody

or locally, as a normal user:
    
    pip install prody --user

Next, you need to install the DFS package itself.

The source files for the most current distribution of DFS are available at 
[LINK]. You can either download the zip package or clone it in any given 
user-available directory by using git:
    
    git clone [LINK2]

If you have downloaded the zip package you need to unzip it:

    unzip dfs.zip

and enter the dfs directory on the terminal. As you're reading this, you have
most likely already performed this last step. The dfs package can then be 
installed system-wise by running in the dfs installation directory:

    sudo python2.7 setup.py install --record files.txt

or, on a per-user basis:

    python2.7 install --user --record files.txt

this will build the Cython/C files as well as copy the installation files in 
their destination directories. If you have installed the package system-wise,
the user-executable scripts will already be available to the user as they are
copied by default in /usr/local/bin. If the installation has been performed
as a normal user, the files are usually located somewhere inside the 
current user's home directory $HOME (usually 
$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dfsutils for the library files and 
$HOME/.local/bin/ for the scripts). The location of these files can be
verified by reading the content of files.txt in the installation
directory, in which the installation location of each file contained in the 
package is written during the installation. 

It is advisable to add the scripts directory in the PATH system variable so 
that they are available from the whole filesystem:

	export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin/

assuming that your script files are located in $HOME/.local/bin/ .

This line can also be added to the .profile or .bashrc file in the user's $HOME
so that it is run every time a shell is opened.


OS X or macOS
--------------

First, in order to build the final packages, it is advisable to install 
Xcode from the App store, and then install the command-line tools by running:

    sudo xcode-select --install

and following the on-screen instructions. Python packages can be easily 
installed using pip. Pip itself can be installed by running:

    sudo easy_install pip

then:

    sudo pip install numpy h5py prody

Alternatively, one can install the MacPorts package system (http://macports.org)
and then install the relevant packages from there:

    sudo port selfupdate && sudo port install py27-setuptools py27-numpy \
    py27-cython py27-pip py27-setuptools py27-h5py
    
However, the prody package still needs to be installed using pip:

    sudo pip-2.7 install numpy h5py prody

After the prerequisites are installed, the installation of DFS itself can be 
performed as in Linux. Namely, you first need to download the zip package of 
DFS and unzip it:

    unzip dfs.zip

then enter the dfs directory on the terminal. As you're reading this, you have
most likely already performed this last step. The dfs package can then be 
installed system-wise by running in the dfs installation directory:

    sudo python2.7 setup.py install --record files.txt

or, on a per-user basis:

    python2.7 install --user --record files.txt

this will build the Cython/C files as well as copy the installation files in 
their destination directory. The position on the file-systems of the installed
files can vary, depending on whether you are using the system Python installa-
tion or the one shipped with MacPorts. However, you will be able to identify
the location of the script files by looking into the files.txt log file
which is written in the installation directory. Once you have determined the
location of the script files in your system it is advisable to add the scripts 
directory in the PATH system variable so that they are available from the 
whole filesystem:

	export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/files/

this line can also be added to the .profile or .bashrc file in the user's $HOME
so that it is run every time a shell is opened.
