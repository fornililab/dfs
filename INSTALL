Prerequisites
---------------

dfs is a collection of Python 2 and Cython libraries and scripts and is 
supported on Linux and OS X/macOS. Installing the dfs package has the following
requirements:

* Python 2.x (>= 2.7)
* Cython >= 0.18
* Python 2 packages: setuptools, numpy
* Python and numpy headers
* a C compiler (as gcc)

Running dfs and analysis scripts also requires the following Python 2.x 
packages:

* h5py >= 2.6.0
* prody 

Please refer to your system administrator or specific OS documentation for 
detailed installation instructions of these packages. In Ubuntu 16.04 and other
Debian-based operating systems they can installed by running:

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cython python-dev python-numpy \
	python-setuptools python-pip python-h5py build-essential

Under OS X and macOS they are easily installed through macports 
(http://macports.org), by running:

	sudo port selfupdate && sudo port install py27-setuptools py27-numpy \
	py27-cython py27-pip py27-setuptools py27-h5py

Under OS X, the C compiler can be installed through XCode 
(http://developer.apple.com). This is also a requirement for installing 
MacPorts.

Finally, for both operating systems, the prody package can be installed by 
running:

	pip install --user prody

Installation
--------------

The dfs package can be installed by running in the dfs installation directory:

	python2.7 setup.py install --user

this will build the Cython/C files as well as copy the installation files in a
 directory inside the current user's home directory $HOME (usually 
$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dfsutils for the library files and 
$HOME/.local/bin/ for the scripts). It is advisable to add the scripts directory
in the PATH system variable so that the scripts are available from the whole
filesystem:

	export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin/

this line can also be added to the .profile or .bashrc file in the user's $HOME
so that it is run every time a shell is opened.
