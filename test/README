In order to run the tests for the this distribution of dfs you need to:

1) Install the DFS package and its prerequisites; please see the INSTALL file
in the main directory of the distribution

2) have the distribution scripts in your PATH, so that they are available from
command line; this is also described in the INSTALL file.

Running the tests #
###################

Just execute the run_test.sh file:

    ./run_tests.sh

the expected output for the script is "TEST PASSED" for all three tests.

If tests fail please check that dfs has been installed correctly and that your
Python environment is sound. If this is the case please open a detailed issue
on the dfs GitHub repository (https://github.com/fornililab/dfs) or contact the
authors for further assistance.

Once a test run is complete, if you need to run it again for further testing,
please clean the test directories by running

    ./clean_tests.sh
